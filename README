Short Answer:

1. To search and replace every instance of the word fun with amazing, 
enter :%s/fun/amazing/g. To only change the first instance of the word,
navigate to that line and enter :%s/fun/amazing without the g flag, which 
only uses the first occurence in the line.

2. To create a directory inside another directory, use the parent command -p
To make a directory called barDir inside a directory fooDir, enter the 
command :mkdir -p fooBar/barDir

3. The wildcard character * represents every string used as the argument.
For example, if we were to list directory :ls *.html, it will list all the 
files with extension .html. Similarly, the command :rm *.html will remove
all files with the .html extension in the directory

4. To open all Java files in the current directory, in separate tabs,
enter the command :gvim -p *.java The star indicates all files to be 
opened with the .java extension

5. The static keyword in a method means it is associated with the class
itself, not with any object. This means that there is no calling object
needed to call upon this method. An example of this is the main, which
is called by Jave runtime to start an application. 

6. Instead of one large class, she can use one super class and 
various subclasses to better organize this. ShapeDrawer will be the 
super class, and methods such as drawBlueCircle will extend it. It will
inherit all the default methods written in the super class, and if necessary,
can be overriden with their own unique methods. In object oriented design, 
this is more practical and made easier for users.
